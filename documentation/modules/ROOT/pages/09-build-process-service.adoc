= Build a Process Service

This lab introduces you to how you can get started with process projects that are based on Kogito and Quarkus, how to deploy and validate it.

-   Create a new quarkus-based process microservice
-   Leverage Kogito tooling in VSCode to design a simple process
-   Run the process in the development environment

== Creating a new process project based on Kogito and Quarkus

In order to create a new process project based on Quarkus, we can use a Maven archetype to generate the Quarkus based project with the required dependencies for our decision application.

WARNING: At the time of writing Kogito Process is still not released in the product, so we are going to explore the latest **community** version 

Navigate to a folder of your preference, and run the following command. Maven will create a new project with the name `process-lab01`.

[source,shell]

mvn archetype:generate \

    -DarchetypeArtifactId=kogito-quarkus-archetype \

== Design the Order Approval process 

1. Create `order-approval.bpmn` in `src/main/resources`:

2. Design the process:

   - **Add** a _Start Event_
   - Next to the _Start Event_ **Click** the box icon to add a task
     ![]({%  image_path/build-process-newtask.gif %}){:width="300px"}
   - **Name** the task `Approve`
   - While the task is selected, **open** the _Properties_ pane, **update** _Task Name_ with `Approve`
     ![]({%  image_path/build-process-task-prop.png %}){:width="500px"}
   - Below the Task from the gear icon **select** the user shape
     ![]({%  image_path/build-process-user-task.gif %}){:width="300px"}
   - Complete the process design **adding** the _End Event_
     ![]({%  image_path/build-process-approval-process.png %}){:width="400px"}

[#run-process]
== Run the process

Kogito generates a set of REST endpoints to interact with the process model at runtime.
You can explore all the endpoints opening the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/).

In this section, we propose the _REST Client_ tool for the following reasons:

1. Often you need the outcome of a service to trigger the following service, a really convenient feature of the _REST Client_ is the variable initialization from the response and this avoid you the burden of coping and pasting those values
2. The `http` file can be stored along with your project and can be easily reused later.
3. It's really fast to repeat the test scenario, because you will have all the REST calls in the correct order.
4. The same file can be reused with the service running in a different environment just changing the `HOST` variable. 

The following steps guide you to start a local Kogito runtime and probe the process model through the basic operations: start a new process instance, read the task list, complete the task and consequently complete the process instance.

1. **Start** the application in dev mode:
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev
----

2. **Create** the file `order-approval.http` in `src/test/http/` folder

3. **Add** the new process REST request:
+
[.console-input]
[source,javascript]
----
@HOST=localhost:8080

###
# @name order_approval
POST http://{{HOST}}/order_approval
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{}

@piid={{order_approval.response.body.id}}
----

4. Start a new process instance **clicking** _Send Request_ link above `POST`, the response body should resemble the following:
+
[.console-output]
[source,json]
----
{
"id": "333ed660-eda6-444b-8d75-6b411c18486d"
}
----
+
TIP: _Rest Client_ parses the response and assign the _process instance id_ to the `piid` variable

5. **Get** the _task list_ and pick the first task id
+
[.console-input]
[source,javascript]
----
###
# @name order_approval_tasks
GET http://{{HOST}}/order_approval/{{piid}}/tasks
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

@taskid={{order_approval_tasks.response.body.0.id}}
@task_name={{order_approval_tasks.response.body.0.name}}
----

6. **Claim** the task
+
[.console-input]
[source,javascript]
----
###
# @name task_claim
POST http://{{HOST}}/order_approval/{{piid}}/{{task_name}}/{{taskid}}?phase=claim
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{}
----

7. **Complete** the task
+
[.console-input]
[source,javascript]
----
###
# @name task_complete
POST http://{{HOST}}/order_approval/{{piid}}/{{task_name}}/{{taskid}}?phase=complete
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{}
